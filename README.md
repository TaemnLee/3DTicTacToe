# 3DTicTacToe

This program is a 3D Tic Tac Toe game where the grid size is (3x3x3).
It can take 2 or 3 players and let the users decide which token they intend to use.

Once the users select the number of players and token for the game, it will ask
each player to input the position where to put their token in format of row, column, and layer.

If a player successfully creates a line in a row, cross, or diagonal, that player wins the game.
